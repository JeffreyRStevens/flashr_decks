Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.\n\n\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [INSERT CONTACT METHOD]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.\nAll community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.\n\n\n\nCommunity leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:\n\n\nCommunity Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\nConsequence: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.\n\n\n\nCommunity Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.\nConsequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.\n\n\n\nCommunity Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.\nConsequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time.

    "text": "Feel free to propose new decks to contribute to flashr_decks. It makes most sense to post decks that other people might be interested in using—for example, based on books or publicly available resources. The best way to do this is to create the CSV files for the decks and submit a pull request. To create the CSV files, create columns titled term, description, package, and title (optional). Then fill in these columns with the terms, descriptions, and packages that you would like included in your flashcards. Check out the flashr documentation for more details on creating decks. Please keep file names short and consistent (e.g., r2ds1.csv for functions from R for Data Science Chapter 1).\nFeel free to contact me to check if a deck idea makes sense for this repository or if you have questions about building decks. Once the decks are built, submit a pull request to add them to the decks/ directory of this repository. Note, all decks posted here (included contributed decks) are published under the MIT license and contributors of decks must abide by the project’s code of conduct.\n\n\nPlease note that the flashr decks project is released with a contributor code of conduct.\nBy participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms."
