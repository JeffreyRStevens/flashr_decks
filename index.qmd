title: "flashr decks"
---

Welcome to the flashcard deck repository for the [flashr](https://github.com/JeffreyRStevens/flashr) R package. flashr creates flashcard decks in HTML to help you learn the meanings of R functions or other term/description pairs.

For example, interested in getting some practice remembering the functions from [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)? flashr has built-in flashcard decks with the functions and descriptions from each of the chapters.

You can check out the [available decks](decks.html) to see what decks are already built or even [contribute your own decks](contribute.html) to the repo for others to use!
