    "text": "Feel free to propose new decks to contribute to flashr_decks. It makes most sense to post decks that other people might be interested in using—for example, based on books or publicly available resources. The best way to do this is to create the CSV files for the decks and submit a pull request. To create the CSV files, create columns titled term, description, package, and title (optional). Then fill in these columns with the terms, descriptions, and packages that you would like included in your flashcards. Check out the flashr documentation for more details on creating decks. Please keep file names short and consistent (e.g., r2ds1.csv for functions from R for Data Science Chapter 1).\nFeel free to contact me to check if a deck idea makes sense for this repository or if you have questions about building decks. Once the decks are built, submit a pull request to add them to the decks/ directory of this repository. Note, all decks posted here (included contributed decks) are published under the MIT license and contributors of decks must abide by the project’s code of conduct.\n\n\nPlease note that the flashr decks project is released with a contributor code of conduct.\nBy participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms."
