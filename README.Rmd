## Proposing decks

Feel free to propose new decks. It makes most sense to post decks that other people might be interested in using---for example, based on books or publicly available resources. The best way to do this is to create the CSV files for the decks and submit a pull request. To create the CSV files, create columns titled `term`, `description`, `package`, and `title` (optional). Then fill in these columns with the terms, descriptions, and packages that you would like included in your flashcards. Check out the flashr documentation for my details on creating decks. Please keep file names short and consistent (e.g., `r2ds1.csv` for functions from *R for Data Science* Chapter 1).

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:jeffrey.r.stevens@protonmail.com) to check if a deck idea makes sense for this repository or if you have questions about building decks. Once the decks are built, submit a pull request to add them to the `decks/` directory of this repository.
