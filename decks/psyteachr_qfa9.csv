alpha,The cutoff value for making a decision to reject the null hypothesis,https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/a.html#alpha,PsyTeachR QFA Ch. 9
alternative hypothesis,the experimental hypothesis formed in Null Hypothesis Significance Testing and is the hypothesis that states that there will be a relationship between variables or an effect of one variable on the other,https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/a.html#alternative-hypothesis,PsyTeachR QFA Ch. 9
assumptions,requirements about your data and your design that must be held for your analysis to have meaning,https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/a.html#assumptions,PsyTeachR QFA Ch. 9
Bonferroni,A correction for multiple comparisons where the accepted alpha level is adjusted by dividing it by the number of comparisons made,https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/b.html#bonferroni,PsyTeachR QFA Ch. 9
conservative analysis,A conservative test is one that is more likely to result in more false negatives - i.e. missed findings - than a test considered less conservative,https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/c.html#conservative-analysis,PsyTeachR QFA Ch. 9
correlation,The relationship two vectors have to each other.,https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/c.html#correlation,PsyTeachR QFA Ch. 9
Holm Bonferroni,A correction for multiple comparisons where an ordinal iterative approach is used comparing each individual test to an adjusted p-value based on the order of p-values. Generally said to be less conservative than Bonferroni,https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/h.html#holm-bonferroni,PsyTeachR QFA Ch. 9
homoscedasticity,that the spread of data around the line of best fit is equal on both side along the length of the line,https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/h.html#homoscedasticity,PsyTeachR QFA Ch. 9
hypothesis,A proposed explanation made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation.,https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/h.html#hypothesis,PsyTeachR QFA Ch. 9
inferential,"Statistics that allow you to make predictions about or comparisons between data (e.g., t-value, F-value, rho)",https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/i.html#inferential,PsyTeachR QFA Ch. 9
line of best fit,"otherwise known as the regression line, it is the line drawn between data points in a scatterplot that best divides the data in half. It is in fact a prediction of where data would fall for a given relationship strength and direction",https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/l.html#line-of-best-fit,PsyTeachR QFA Ch. 9
multiple comparisons,An issue of running mutlitple tests which results in an increase in the false positive rate making it more likely that you will incorrectly reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis. The issue is resolved through correction for multiple comparisons,https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/m.html#multiple-comparisons,PsyTeachR QFA Ch. 9
negative relationship,"a relationship between two variables where as one variable increases, the other variable also decreases",https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/n.html#negative-relationship,PsyTeachR QFA Ch. 9
non significant,The conclusion where the p-value is greater than the critical alpha and at which the null hypothesis is retained,https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/n.html#non-significant,PsyTeachR QFA Ch. 9
normal distribution,A symmetric distribution of data where values near the centre are most probable.,https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/n.html#normal-distribution,PsyTeachR QFA Ch. 9
null hypothesis,the defauly hypothesis in Null Hypothesis Significance Testing and is the hypothesis that states that there will be no effect or relationship in your study.,https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/n.html#null-hypothesis,PsyTeachR QFA Ch. 9
Pearson,a standardised measure of the linear relationship between two variables,https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/p.html#pearson,PsyTeachR QFA Ch. 9
positive relationship,"a relationship between two variables where as one variable increases, the other variable also increases",https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/p.html#positive-relationship,PsyTeachR QFA Ch. 9
q q plot,"A scatterplot created by plotting two sets of quantiles against each other, used to check if data come from a specified distribution",https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/q.html#q-q-plot,PsyTeachR QFA Ch. 9
residual,Defined as the deviation of an observation from a model&#39;s expected value.,https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/r.html#residual,PsyTeachR QFA Ch. 9
scatterplot,a visualisation where each individual data point shows the value of an observation on twi variables.,https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/s.html#scatterplot,PsyTeachR QFA Ch. 9
significant,The conclusion where the p-value is lower than the critical alpha and at which the null hypothesis is rejected,https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/s.html#significant,PsyTeachR QFA Ch. 9
Spearman,a standardised measure of the relationship between two variables that does not assume a linear relationship. Note that the relationship can be linear but it is not required.,https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/s.html#spearman,PsyTeachR QFA Ch. 9
variable,an aspect about your sample or population that can be measured,https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/v.html#variable,PsyTeachR QFA Ch. 9
